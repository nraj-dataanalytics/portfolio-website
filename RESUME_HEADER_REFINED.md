## Files Modified

## Design Rationale

### Why Remove "My professional journey"?
1. **Generic language** - Doesn't add specific value
2. **Redundant** - Section title already clear
3. **Not resume-appropriate** - Resumes should be direct, not narrative
4. **Excess verbiage** - Takes up visual space without purpose
5. **Inconsistent tone** - Other sections don't use personal storytelling

### Why Reduce Spacing?
1. **Improve scanability** - Users can see content faster
2. **Premium aesthetic** - Tight, intentional spacing feels more professional
3. **Better hierarchy** - Content gets appropriate prominence
4. **Consistency** - Matches spacing patterns in other sections

### User Experience:
